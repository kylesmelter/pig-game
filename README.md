Pig Dice Game

Disclaimer: The HTML and CSS are NOT mine. The only code I wrote in this project is the JavaScript.

The classic Pig Dice Game where two players try to obtain an overall score of 100 by taking turns rolling dice. Players roll a dice, and the value is added to their current score. If the current player clicks the "Hold" button, their current score is added to their overall score, and the current player changes to the other player. If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and the current player changes to the other player.
